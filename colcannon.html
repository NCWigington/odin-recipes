<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mashed potatoes and some greens. Yum!    
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
    <li>2 cups thinly sliced cabbage</li>
    <li>¼ cup milk, warmed</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, 
        then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam 
        dry for a minute or two. </li>
    <li> Place the cabbage into a microwave-safe bowl, and add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water. 
        Cover and microwave on High for about 2 1/2 minutes; uncover (watch out for steam) 
        and stir the cabbage. Cover and microwave for about 2 1/2 more minutes, until the 
        cabbage is slightly tender but not mushy. Drain excess liquid, and set the cabbage aside, covered.</li> 
    <li>Place the potatoes into a large bowl, and add milk, butter, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. 
        Beat the potatoes with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir in the cabbage, crumbled bacon, 
        and parsley until well combined.</li>
    <li>To serve, place a scoop of colcannon onto a plate, make a hollow, and 
        fill with braised beef stew or any soup you have ready on hand.</li>
</ol>

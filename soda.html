    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>I imagine I will never eat an Irish soda bread that is better than the one 
    made for my birthday sub-crawl in Glasgow, but this one will come a very 
    close 2nd. It is a very easy, very good tasting bread. 
    Best if made the day before, or several hours before serving. (recipe from AllRecipes.com)

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
        Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
    </li> 
    <li>Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, salt and baking 
        soda. Blend egg and buttermilk together, and add all 
        at once to the flour mixture. Mix just until moistened. 
        Stir in butter. Pour into prepared pan.
     </li> 
    <li>Bake for 65 to 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted 
        in the bread comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. 
        Wrap in foil for several hours, or overnight, for best 
        flavor.
    </li> 
</ol>
